# Node 20 typescript boilerplate

> 🚀 Boilerplate Application with Node.js 20, TypeScript 5, ESLint, Prettier, Mocha, and Husky


## Description

This project provides an opinionated boilerplate for quickly setting up Node.js applications.

✨ Node.js 20 ✨ TypeScript 5 ✨ ESLint ✨ Prettier ✨ Mocha ✨ Husky ✨


## Using the boilerplate

To use this boilerplate, follow these steps:

    git clone <repository-url> <your-project-name>
    cd <project-name>
    npm install
    rm -rf .git
    git init
Don't forget to change the `package.json` file with correct information.


After installing the dependencies, you can start building your application. The following scripts are available:

🛠️ `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript, creating a dist directory with the transpiled files.

🚦 `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to analyze and lint your codebase for potential errors or style violations.

✨ `npm run lint:fix`: Fixes all auto-fixable linting problems.

🧪 `npm test`: Runs the Mocha test suite to execute your unit tests.

▶️ `npm start`: Starts the application in development mode.

Feel free to modify the configuration files (tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.js, and .prettierrc.json) according to your project requirements.
